## Project Summary
FindMyPark NYC is a web application designed to help New York City residents find their most suitable parks based on their needs. From natural preserves to amusement parks, New York City provides a range of options for outdoor entertainment. However, existing navigation apps make it difficult for users to find parks with specific facilities they care about such as natural grass soccer fields or restrooms, and relying on physical park maps is often inconvenient and time-consuming.
Our app is built upon real datasets from NYC Open Data(park properties, athletic facilities, …) and present in an interactive map format. This allows users to search and filter by a list of their preferences including distance, amenities, opening time.
